# phantom_bios
don't worry bruhh ,, this project is still under a coocking condition so you better wait for it ,,,
so what this project does , 
it's just a normal computer bios setup, but combined with hardware utilities, and 
the other thing is it's made for booting multiple operating systems,,, 
so if you haven't checked my other repositories,, lemme introduce them , 
they're basically a web operating systems but they work as an emulator only cause it's not allowed to do every operations , but it can have several things as a causal OS should have.
so I made this repository to connect those operating systems project combined with this repo,.
so enjoy, and try to find maximum glitches from this project cause I'm a dumbass who tryna do any dope shit...
